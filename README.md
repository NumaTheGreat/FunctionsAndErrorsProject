# LalapRev Smart Contract

## Overview

The **LalapRev** smart contract is a simple Solidity contract designed to demonstrate the use of error handling mechanisms such as `require`, `revert`, and `assert`. The contract includes three functions (`req`, `rev`, and `ass`) that modify the state variable `totalSupply` based on certain conditions.

## Functionality
- `req(uint integer) public`: Adds the input integer to totalSupply if integer is greater than one.
- `rev(uint integer) public`: Adds the input integer to totalSupply if integer is greater than one.
- `ass(uint integer) public`: Adds the input integer to totalSupply if integer is greater than one.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Compile the contracts: `truffle compile`
4. Migrate the contracts: `truffle migrate`
5. Run tests: `truffle test`
